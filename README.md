## License

   This program is licensed under the terms of GNU Public License. You can read
   it at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 or you can find a file
   LICENSE in this directory with a plain text copy of it.

## What this program does

* Shows the health of a license server or a group of them
* Check which licenses are being used and who is currently using them
* Get a listing of licenses, their expiration days and number of days to expiration
* E-mail alert of licenses that will expire within certain time period ie. within next 10 days.
* Monitors server utilization
* Provides usage charts

## Warning

   There is no warranty on this package.  We wrote this system to help keep
   tabs on our FlexLM servers.  We are not FlexLM developers and base this
   system on using the publicly available commands such as lmstat, lmdiag.
   This may not work for you.  No specific platform is targeted, but
   development and testing is primarily done withÂ Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS.

   Please do not run phplicensewatcher on a publicly available Internet server
   because it has not been audited to make sure it is secure.  It likely isn't.
   You have been warned.

## Limitations

   Currently FlexLM and MathLM (Mathematica) servers are supported but in the
   future a wider array of license servers may be supported.

## Requirements


* 64-bit PHP enabled web server
* MySQL (MariaDB is not officially targeted, but has received community support)
* FlexLM lmutil binary for the OS you are running the web server on.

## Install process
1. Retrieve required packages for your OS/distribution:
   * Apache2
   * PHP 7.3 or higher
   * MySQL-server, MySQL-client, PHP MySQL Extension
   * You need the Linux Standard Base (LSB) to run Linux-precompiled FlexLM binaries.

   For example, using Ubuntu 20.04:
   ```
   sudo apt install apache2 php mysql-server mysql-client php-mysql lsb
   ```
2. Clone repository locally using git
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rpi-dotcio/phpLicenseWatcher.git /var/www/html/
   ```
3. Create the database
   ```
   mysqladmin create licenses
   mysql -f licenses < phplicensewatcher.sql
   ```
4. Copy "config/sample-config.php" to "./config.php" and edit it for the proper values for your setup.  Brief instructions are provided within the file as code comments.

5. Setup cron to run scheduled tasks
   ```
   0 6 * * 1 php /var/www/html/license_alert.php >> /dev/null
   0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * php /var/www/html/license_util.php >> /dev/null
   15 0 * * 1  php /var/www/html/license_cache.php >> /dev/null
   ```
6. You should use your web server's built in capabilities to password protect your site.
7. Navigate to page `check_installation.php` to check for possible installation issues.

### Crontab details

There are CLI scripts that need to be executed ie. license_util.php and license_cache.php.

* License_util.php is used to get current license usage. It should be run periodically throughout the day ie. every 10 minutes.
* License_cache.php stores the total number of available licenses on particular day. This script is necessary because you may have temporary keys that may expire on a particular day and you want to capture that. It should be run once a day preferably soon after the midnight after which license server should invalidate all the expired keys.
* license_alert.php checks for expiring licenses and emails admins.  We run once a week.
